# Gorgeous SIMulations

gsim is a DSL for statistical simulations. Its goals are:

* Automating loops over simulations, letting you focus on the
  mathematics of your computations rather than the technicalities.

  This should not come at the expense of performance. gsim tries to
  vectorise operations when appropriate.

* Help you creating numerical and graphical summaries of parameters
  and fitted models.

Have a look at the
[introduction vignette](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/239966/gsim.html)
for a tutorial.

To install the package:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("lionelgit/gsim")
```
